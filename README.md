## See upvotes and HN comments while browsing the web

This Chrome extension shows the number of [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) upvotes for the current URL (if the URL has been submitted to HackerNews, obviously).

Clicking the extension icon will open HN comments for this page.

**Which is, actually, the reason we built this tool.** Sometimes when stumbled on a great piece of content, I'm always wondering "what would the HN crowd have to say abot this?" Because the comments at NackerNews are sometimes even more interesting that the piece itself.
